Alpha3:
	Empty blocks implemented, minor bugs and documentation corrections.
0.4:
	Too many. (Some of these could be present in ALpha3 too).
	New style of horizontal offset added. 
	New interface for layoutCmd added. 3 styles: 1 element, 7
	elements, 13 elements (last ones recognized, but not supported).
	New style of addline and deletelines.
	Works with Perl.
	First argument to layout callback now contains widget name too. 
	Used in Equation to get width of the screen.
	Deletion works better, now deletes as deep a split as needed.
0.4.1:
	Now patches one file in Tk only. Now recompile of Tk should be
	_very_ quick (reinstall can be slow).
0.4.2:
	One file was (erroneously) a link outside the tree. The rest
	of links should be corrected.
0.4.3:
	A warning for missing file busted the test on different sites.
0.4.4:
	(Under Perl:)  Now the second component of the first argument of
	layoutCallback is not the name of the widget, but actual reference to
	the widget. However, a patch to tkGlue.c is needed. Not released
	because of this.
0.4.5:
	One minor bug corrected, updated to sync with Tk-b8 and tk4.0p1.
	No recompile of Tk is necessary.
0.4.6:
	Selection bug corrected, Tab works again (ListFactoryAppendList 
	added), environment variable `kprefix' denotes prefixes for
	special keys (default `Control-Meta-').
0.4.7:
	Hidden leaves where not hidden from BBox and Measure.
	Perl demo updated (now only the pedestal is missing).
	Doc brushed up by Norm Shelley.
0.5.0:
	Selection and search work. `txtWgt config -getFlags 1' works.
0.5.1:
	Note that case conversion during extraction works with DStrings only. 
	Verbose mode works, making it possible to have Load/Save in
		Perl demo.
	Temporarily verbose output is put on 'block list' subcommand.
	Menubar added to Perl demo. (TeX from selection is not working so far).
	Minimal TeX import added.
0.5.2:
	Minor documentation fixes. Table block coded in Perl demo.
	Algorithm of finding @x,y may return start and end of a block now.
	One could not render a block with data.
	Block insertion could eat the last fake line into block.
	Makefile.PL (for Perl build) updated for Tk-b10-tobe.
0.5.3:
	Warning from gcc -Wall -Wno-comment -Wno-unused corrected.

MarkFindPrev need additional work: there are two modes for going out
of tree: when we did not reach the target position, and when we did.
TkIBTreeLastLine???
TagRootPtr... TkBTreeStartSearch TkBTreePrevTag
Methods.def manually created.

0.6.1:
	Bug with tags togglecount when going out of IBTree corrected.
	Cleaned up Makefile.PL (might break the install if inside Tk tree).

0.6.2:
	Should work inside Tk directory too.
